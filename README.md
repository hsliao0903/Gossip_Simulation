# Gossip Protocol Simulation

This is a simulation project that simulates the Gossip Protocol and use this protocol to implement push-sum protocol. 
Also, it provides several different network topologies which plays a critical role in the dissemination of Gossip protocol.

The paper about Gossip protocol and the use of push-sum protocol is listed below:
[Gossip-Based Computation of Aggregate Information](https://github.com/hsliao0903/Gossip_Simulation/blob/master/Gossip_Papers/focs2003-gossip.pdf )
 
Please see [Report.pdf](https://github.com/hsliao0903/Gossip_Simulation/blob/master/Report.pdf) for more implementation details and simulation conclusions.
